# Task ID: 5
# Title: Implement Text Highlighting System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create system to visually highlight flagged words with yellow background while preserving text formatting
# Details:
Create TextHighlighter component that takes original text and flagged words array. Implement algorithm to split text into segments (normal text and flagged words) using startIndex and endIndex. Create highlighted spans with yellow background using TailwindCSS (bg-yellow-200). Preserve original text formatting including line breaks and spacing. Handle overlapping or adjacent flagged words correctly. Ensure proper text selection and copy behavior.

# Test Strategy:
Test with various text inputs including edge cases (punctuation, line breaks). Verify highlighting accuracy with different word positions. Test text selection and copy functionality. Validate performance with large text inputs.
