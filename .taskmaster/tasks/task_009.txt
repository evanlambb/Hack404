# Task ID: 9
# Title: Add Undo/Redo Functionality for Word Replacements
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 7
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement undo/redo system to allow users to revert or reapply word changes
# Details:
Create history management system using useReducer or custom hook. Maintain stack of text states for undo/redo operations. Implement undo/redo buttons with proper disabled states. Add keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+Z for undo, Ctrl+Y for redo). Store both text content and flagged words state in history. Limit history size to prevent memory issues (max 50 operations). Provide visual feedback for undo/redo actions.

# Test Strategy:
Test undo/redo functionality with multiple word replacements. Verify keyboard shortcuts work correctly. Test history limits and memory management. Validate proper state restoration.
