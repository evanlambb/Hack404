# Task ID: 7
# Title: Implement One-Click Word Replacement Functionality
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 6
# Priority: medium
# Description: Add functionality to replace flagged words with selected suggestions and update text state
# Details:
Create word replacement logic that updates original text when suggestion is clicked. Implement text reconstruction algorithm that replaces specific word instances using startIndex/endIndex. Update component state to reflect changes and re-render highlighted text. Handle multiple word replacements and maintain proper text indices. Add visual feedback for successful replacements (brief highlight or animation). Ensure replacement preserves surrounding text formatting and spacing.

# Test Strategy:
Test word replacement accuracy with various text positions. Verify multiple replacements work correctly. Test edge cases like punctuation and special characters. Validate text state consistency after replacements.
