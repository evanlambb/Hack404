# Description: Build side-by-side or toggle view to compare original text with modified text
# Details:
Create ComparisonView component with two text display areas. Implement toggle between side-by-side and stacked layouts for responsive design. Style original text area with subtle background (gray-50) and modified text with success background (green-50). Add clear labels ('Original' and 'Improved'). Highlight changed words in both versions for easy comparison. Include toggle button to switch between comparison and single view modes. Ensure proper responsive behavior on mobile devices.

# Test Strategy:
Test comparison view on different screen sizes. Verify changed words are properly highlighted. Test toggle functionality between view modes. Validate responsive layout behavior.
