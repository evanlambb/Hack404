# Task ID: 11
# Title: Add Loading States and Error Handling
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement comprehensive loading states during API calls and error handling for API failures
# Details:
Create loading spinner component with TailwindCSS animations. Implement loading state management during API calls using useState. Add skeleton loading for text analysis results. Create error boundary component for unexpected errors. Implement user-friendly error messages for different failure scenarios (network error, API timeout, invalid response). Add retry functionality for failed API calls. Disable submit button during loading to prevent multiple requests. Style error states with appropriate colors and icons.

# Test Strategy:
Test loading states with simulated slow network. Verify error handling for various failure scenarios. Test retry functionality works correctly. Validate error messages are user-friendly and actionable.
