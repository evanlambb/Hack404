    <h1>Hate Speech Detection Test Page</h1>
    
    <div class="test-section">
        <h2>Normal Content</h2>
        <p>This is a normal paragraph with neutral content. It contains no offensive language and should not be highlighted by the hate speech detector.</p>
        
        <p>Here's another paragraph discussing technology. Modern web browsers support many advanced features that make browsing more secure and efficient.</p>
        
        <p>This paragraph talks about positive community building. Working together and supporting each other creates stronger communities where everyone can thrive.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="test-section">
        <h2>Potentially Problematic Content</h2>
        <p>This paragraph contains some potentially problematic language that might be flagged by hate speech detection systems, depending on the sensitivity settings.</p>
        
        <p>Testing content with various types of language to see how the AI model responds to different contexts and phrases.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="test-section">
        <h2>Mixed Content</h2>
        <p>This paragraph starts with normal content but then includes some potentially offensive language mixed in with regular text to test partial highlighting.</p>
        
        <p>Another test paragraph that combines neutral discussion with potentially problematic elements to evaluate the precision of the detection system.</p>
        <p> I hate black people</p>
        <p>Women are useless</p>
